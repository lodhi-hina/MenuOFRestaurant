```

**Changes and Improvements:**

* **Consolidated CSS:** All CSS is now in one file (`styles.css`). This makes maintenance *much* easier and improves performance (one less file to download).
* **Consistent Navigation:** The navigation bar is now styled consistently across all pages using the shared CSS.
* **Improved about.html:** The content is simplified and slightly reworded for better clarity. The container has been centered, rounded corners and a subtle box shadow added.
* **Responsive Font Sizes:** Font sizes are now specified using `em` units or viewport units like `vh` for headings. This significantly improves responsiveness, making text scale better with different screen sizes. You may still need to fine-tune these.
* **General Link Styling:** Added `a { text-decoration: none; }` to remove underlines from all links by default. Then, add underline on hover for `.contact-details a` (if desired). This improves the look of links in the About section.
* **Spacing:** Added margins to headings and paragraphs for better readability.
* **Media Queries:**  Combine and adjust media queries from `menu.css` and `index.css` into `styles.css` to maintain responsiveness across all pages. Consider simplifying/consolidating them where possible.
* **Removed Unnecessary Sections:** Removed empty sections (`<section id="home"></section>`, `<section id="about"></section>`, etc.) from `about.html`,  `index.html`, and `menu.html` as they were not being used.



**Next Steps:**

1. **Complete `styles.css`:**  Copy the styles from `index.css`, `menu.css`, and the `style` tag in `contact.html` into `styles.css`. Be mindful of any conflicting styles and make them more specific if needed (e.g., `.menu-item h3` instead of just `h3`).
2. **Test Thoroughly:** Test your website on different screen sizes and browsers to ensure everything looks good and works as expected.
3. **Order Button Functionality:** The "Order" buttons are currently just placeholders. You'll need to implement JavaScript or a backend system to handle actual order processing.
4. **Image Optimization:** Optimize the images you are using (especially the large background images) to reduce their file size, which will improve loading times. Use a service like TinyPNG or ShortPixel.
5. **Accessibility:** Review and improve your website's accessibility for users with disabilities. Use semantic HTML, provide alt text for all images, ensure sufficient color contrast, and so on.


This restructured approach will greatly enhance your website's organization, maintainability, and user experience.
